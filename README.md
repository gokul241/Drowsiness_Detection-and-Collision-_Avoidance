# Drowsiness_Detection-and-Collision-_Avoidance
Project to detect the  Driver Drowsiness detection system and alert system which also contains a collision avoidance system to prevent accidents.

## Overview

The Driver Drowsiness Detection and Collision Avoidance project aims to enhance road safety by employing computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect driver drowsiness and potential collisions. Fatigue and distraction are significant contributors to road accidents, and this project addresses these issues by alerting the driver when signs of drowsiness are detected and providing collision avoidance assistance.

The system employs a network of sensors to continuously monitor the driver’s physiological and behavioral parameters, detecting signs of drowsiness in real-time. Simultaneously, the sensing framework extends to the vehicle’s surroundings,employing environmental sensors to assess potential collision risks. Upon detecting driver fatigue or an impending collision, the system activates timely alerts for the driver and implements autonomous measures for collision avoidance, such as automatic braking or steering interventions.This advanced system not only focuses on the continuous monitoring of the driver but also integrates a sophisticated network of environmental sensors to evaluate potential collision risks in the vehicle’s vicinity.

## Features

  - Drowsiness Detection: Utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect signs of driver drowsiness, such as eye closure or head nodding.
  - Real-time Monitoring: Constantly monitors the driver's behavior and facial expressions to identify potential fatigue or distraction.
  - Alert System: Issues warnings or alarms to alert the driver when signs of drowsiness are detected, prompting them to take necessary breaks or corrective actions.
  - Collision Avoidance: Employs collision detection algorithms to identify potential hazards and provide warnings or automatic interventions to prevent accidents.
  - Customizable Settings: Offers configurable settings for alert thresholds, sensitivity levels, and intervention mechanisms to adapt to individual preferences and driving conditions.
  - Data Logging: Records driving behavior and events for analysis and evaluation, providing insights for further improvements in road safety.
